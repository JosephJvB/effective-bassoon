# Damnit sam

Wanna:
1. use changesets > auto update cloudformation stack
2. create codebuild step to run sam/aws package command for me
    - I cant create codebuild resource, AWS has an error message??
3. add a testing check step on github
4. prevent remote pushes to master branch (Can't see an obvious way to do this from branch rules?)
